/* PHP General Best Practices */

Data:

	Use PDO
	Use prepared statements only with user submitted variables in query


XSS:

	Escape form data using HTMLSpecialChars


Exceptions:

	Use try/catch on any queries.


Links:
	
	Pages: Root-relative "/" (BASE_URL)
	Include files: Absolute server paths using $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] (ROOT_PATH)
	Put trailing slashes in teh Constants?
	Use BASE_URL, ROOT PATH

Redirects:
	404: Not found
	301: Permanently Moved
	500: Internal Server Error

MYSQL
	USERS:
	Create users with permissions they need only.
	Front end/admin users: CRUD only.
	Possible other users: Read only, Schema Change


	FUNCTIONS:
		NUMERIC:
		SUM(column_name)
		AVG(column_name)
		COUNT(column_name)
		MIN(column_name)
		MAX(column_name) 
		IFNULL(CALC(),0)   // sets value to 0 if null

		STRING:
		LOWER(column_name)
		UPPER(column_name)
		LENGTH(column_name)
		CONCAT(multiple arguments separated with comma)
		SUBSTRING(string,startChar,totalChars)	// 1 based index

		AGGREGATE:
		GROUP BY	// use this for aliases or calucalations you have done within query - goes at the end of query

	FOREIGN KEYS:
	Use for relational table fields (normalization)
	INDEXES:
	Don't use too many

	JOINS:
	Think of it as 2 circles.
	Outer
	Left Outer
	Right Outer
	Inner
